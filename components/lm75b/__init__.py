The LM75B is a temperature-to-digital converter using an on-chip band gap 
temperature sensor and Sigma-Delta A-to-D conversion technique with an 
overtemperature detection output. 

The temperature register always stores an 11-bit two’s complement data 
giving a temperature resolution of 0.125 °C.
